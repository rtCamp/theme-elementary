A starter theme that facilitates a quick head start for developing new [block-based themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview/) along with a bunch of developer-friendly features.

```

## Get Started :rocket:

### Method 1 (Recommended)
```
composer create-project rtcamp/elementary [folder_name]
```
This command is equivalent to cloning the repository and running `composer install && npm install`

### Method 2
Manually clone this repository using
```
git clone [URL to Git repo]
```
Having cloned this repository, install node packages and PHP dependencies using
```
composer install
```

In both the methods, you will be prompted with a theme setup wizard which will help you with the search-replace. That was all! You're good to go with building your block theme. :sparkles:

**Note**: Refer to the `.nvmrc` file to check the supported Node.js version for running this project. If your current Node.js version does not run the project successfully on localhost, please use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on your terminal to configure the right Node.js version.
